# ELEC391_Software

This repository contains all code written by myself in embedded C and MATLAB, as well as my final project report. The code was written to implement the controls software of a simulated 3 DOF (Degree of Freedom) Robotic arm for my electrical design studio course (ELEC 391 at UBC). The robot arm was simulated as I had to take this course under restrictions COVID-19 imposed on in-person teaching at the time.
